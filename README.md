🌍 Trip Advisor Clone

🚀 Project Overview

This project is a detailed **UI (User Interface) clone** of the Trip Advisor homepage. It was developed to practice and master modern front-end layout techniques, primarily **CSS Flexbox** and **CSS Grid**, while focusing on building a highly **responsive** and reusable component-based structure.

The final result is a clean, structured, and visually appealing homepage featuring listings, a dynamic search area, and a complex multi-column footer, all designed to adapt perfectly across various screen sizes.

💻 Technologies Used


HTML - Used for the semantic structure and content organization. 
CSS - Used for all styling, layout, and visual design. 
Flexbox - Essential for one-dimensional alignment (Header, Navigation). 
CSS Grid - Used for creating the multi-column, dynamic card layouts in the main content area. 
Media Queries - Implemented to ensure full responsiveness across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports. 

✨ Key Features
